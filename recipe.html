        <h3><em><u>History</u></em></h3>

            Soda bread, although often attributed to Ireland as Irish soda bread, comes from the <u>Native Americans</u> who would make a 
            <br>
            leavened bread with pearl ash. This method of making a sweeter more scone-like bread became popular in Ireland in the mid 
            <br>
            19th century, but instead of ash, they used baking soda (bicarbonate). Bread as a whole has been around for centuries, 
            <br>
            people have been baking and consuming bread since the earlies recorded findings of bread in the middle east around 
            <br>
            8000 BC. The earlier forms of bread were much different than the bread that we know today, the original form of bread
            <br>
            can be most similarly compared to what we now know as a tortilla. Grain was crushedand baked along with other
            <br>
            ingredients to make this early form of bread, no yeast or other leavening agent was used.
